#Java 10

Released in March 2018, non LTS, end of support is September 2018 for Open JDK

##Local Variable Type Inference

Java 10 introduced var as a reserved type name that can be used for initializing local variable without declaring it explicitly. The idea of var is to reduce boilerplate code and increase readability.

```java
    //declaring variable explicitly
    BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("path/file"));

    //using var
    var bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("path/file"));

    //declaring variable explicitly
    List list = new ArrayList<String>();

    //using var
    var list = new ArrayList<String>();

```

At compile time, compiler infers a type based on initialization part of object

Type inference before Java 10

```java

    List<String> = new ArrayList<String>();

    List<String> = new ArrayList<>();

    Predicate<String> predicate = (String s) -> s.length() > 3;

    Predicate<String> predicate = s -> s.length() > 3;  

```


From Java 10, creating class or interface with name var is not possible because var is a reserved type name. However, class or interface with name Var can be created.

```java
    public class var {
    //compile error: var cannot be used for type declarations
    } 

    public class Var {

    }
```

###How var cannot be used in code:

var cannot be used as a field type, method parameter type or constructor parameter type.

Because var is a reserved type name, methods and fields can be named var

```java

    class SomeClass {
        private int var;

        public void var() {

        }   
    }
    
```

var must be initialized

```java
    //compile error, var must be initialized
    var x;

```

var cannot be referenced to a null

```java
    //compile error, cannot infer type, var initializer is null 
    var x = null;
    
```

Also, var is not allowed in a compound declaration.

```java
    //compile error, cannot infer type
    var i, j =0;
    
```

var cannot replace type of lambda expression
```java
    
    var lambda = x -> x > 3
    
```

##How to and not to use var:

Choose a good variable name

```java

    var x = dbConnection.executeQuery(query);  //bad example

    var users = dbConnection.executeQuery(query); //good example

```

Use good initializer information

```java

    var user = get();  //bad example

    var users = getUsers(); //good example

    var user = getUser(); //good example

```

Take care with <>
```java

    var users = new ArrayList<>();  //bad example - ArrayList<Object> is inferred

    var users = new ArrayList<User>(); //good example - ArrayList<User> is inferred

```

don't use var for initializing anonymous object
```java
    
    var object = new Object(){} // the type of the object variable is Object$1 extends Object

    object = new Object(); // won't compile, object type isn't compatible with Object$1 which is inferred type of the variable
    
```

intersection types
```java
    
    var list = List.of(1, 2.0, "3");

    // type => List<Serializable & Comparable<? extends Serializable & Comparable<?>>>
    
```

##OrElseThrow

Java 8 introduced Optional API for preventing the NullPointerException by wrapping the object that we suspect may be null. Java 10 introduced orElseThrow() method which can be called on object type Optional and it will throw NoSuchElementException if object inside the Optional is null.

```java

    Optional<String> optional = Optional.empty();

    optional.orElseThrow() // Will throw NoSuchElementException

```

##APIs for creating unmodifiable collections

Java 10 added List.copyOf, Set.copyOf, Map.copyOf for creating the unmodifiable collection with copied instances of other collection

```java

    var cars = new ArrayList<String>(List.of("Opel", "Mercedes", "Toyota"));

    var unmodifiableCarList = List.copyOf(cars);

    unmodifiableCarList.add("Audi"); //Will throw UnsupportedOperationException

```
Difference between Collections.unmodifiableList(cars) and List.copyOf(cars)
```java

    var cars = new ArrayList<>(List.of("Opel", "Mercedes", "Toyota"));

    var unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(cars);

    var unmodifiableCopiedList = List.copyOf(cars);

    cars.add("Haudi");

    System.out.println("Unmodifiable list: " + unmodifiableList);
    System.out.println("Unmodifiable copied list: " + unmodifiableCopiedList);

    /* 
        Output:
        Unmodifiable list: [Opel, Mercedes, Toyota, Haudi]
        Unmodifiable copied list: [Opel, Mercedes, Toyota]
    */

```

Also, unmodifiable collection can be created from stream using Collectors.toUnmodifiableList, Collectors.toUnmodifiableSet, Collectors.toUnmodifiableMap

```java

    var stream = list.stream().collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());
    
    stream.add("test"); //Will throw UnsupportedOperationException

```
## Other improvements
* [Graal](https://github.com/oracle/graal) As a result of JVM CI
* G1GC improvements (introduction of full parallel processing during a Full GC), This change won’t help the best-case performance times of the garbage collector, but it does significantly reduce the worst-case latencies.  
* Thread-local handshakes  
During serviceability operations, like collecting stack traces for all threads or performing garbage collections, when the JVM needed to pause one thread, it needed to stop them all. Sometimes, these are referred to as “stop-the-world” pauses. This was due to the JVM wanting to create a global safepoint from which all application threads could begin again once the JVM was done.
In Java 10, though, the JVM can put an arbitrary number of threads into a safepoint, and threads may continue running after performing the prescribed “handshake”. The result is that if the JVM can pause just one thread at a time, whereas before it had to pause them all.
