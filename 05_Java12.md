# Java 12

## API Updates
* New String Methods in preparation for raw strings : 
  * `String::indent` 
  * `String::transform`

* Compact Number Format
```
NumberFormat shortNF = NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance()`
String short = shortNF.format(2000);
System.out.println(short) 
// prints 2k
```
Locale and decimals are configurable off course. Also, it is possible to create custom compact number pattern.

* The Teeing Collector  
In short, Teeing Collector is Collector which merges the results of two other collectors.  Every element passed to the resulting collector is processed by both downstream collectors, then their results are merged using the specified merge function into the final result.

```java
Stream<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5);
long avarage = numbers.collect(
	Collectors.teeing(
		Collectors.summingInt(Integer::valueOf), 
		Collectors.counting(), 
		(sum, count) -> sum/count
		)
	);
//avarage ==> 3
```

* Files::mismatch
Checks if two files are the same. 
`Files.mismatch(Path.of("/file1"), Path.of("/file1"))`  
This method returns -1 if files are identical. Otherwise it returns position of first mismatching byte, or the size of the smaller file (in bytes) when the files are different sizes and every byte of the smaller file is identical to the corresponding byte of the larger file. 

## Switch Expressions 
Switch expressions are first "preview feature" in Java. Preview feature is a new concept introduced in Java 12. 
A preview language or VM feature is a new feature of the Java SE Platform that is fully specified, fully implemented, and yet impermanent. 
It is similar to incubator modules. Difference is that incubator modules are referring to new APIs while, as already stated, preview features refer to new language or VM features.   
Enable incubator modules flag: `--add-modules jdk.incubator.httpclient`  
Enable preview features flag: `--enable-preview`
In IntelliJ this can be done on: `file/project structure/project language level` and `preferences/.../java compiler/additional command line parameters`

## Java Micro-benchmarking Harness JMH
Measure execution time for small pieces of code. 
Can be used to compare alternatives or to prevent performance regressions. 
Advantages of JMH compared to ancient System.currentTimeMillis approach: 
* JMH Handles JVM warm-up
* Consistent reporting
* Multithreading support

Possible pitfalls of using JMH: 
* Dead code elimination
* Other compiler optimizations
* Assumptions
 
JMH has been developed as part of open jdk long time ago. In Java 12, JDK team added JMH to JDK source code and created a set of  arround 100 testsuites in JDK, making JMH defacto standard micro-benchmarking suite.   
Note that JMH is still a separate project. If you want to include it to your project have a look at:

## JVM Changes

### G1 improvements
Promptly return unused committed memory from.
The main goal for this feature is to improve the G1 garbage collector to immediately return Java heap memory to the operating system when inactive. To achieve this goal, G1 will–during low application activity–periodically generate or continue a concurrent cycle to check the complete Java heap usage.

This will trigger it to immediately return unused Java heap portions to the operating system. When under user control, there’s an option to perform a full GC to maximize the volume of memory returned.
### Shenandoah
 Shenandoah is an experimental, low-pause-time garbage collector which targets large heap applications.
 It is contributed by Red Hat, and for some reason Oracle excludes it from their Open JDK build.   
 According to Red Hat, pause times are no longer in direct proportion with the size of the heap. In theory, this means that a heap that’s 2 GB should have the same pause time as a heap that’s 200 GB.

### JVM Constants API
This is Low-level JVM feature that can be helpful for tools that manipulate classes and methods.
